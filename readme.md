# Let's Get started!
- We will be covering
	- Randomness and its requirement in blockchain
	- Problem with generating on-chain randomness
	- About oracles and Random Number Generation
	- About Witnet Oracle
	- Random number generation contract from Witnet
	- Building our lottery contract
	- Testing the contract
## Requirement of Randomness
- Most applications require randomness in some sort
- Let's take for example a gambling contract(like our own), these contracts award people based on luck, and luck is random
- For these luck-based applications to work, the randomness must be tamper-proof so that no one can exploit
- While in the field of blockchain and smart contracts, there are some problems 
## Problem with On-Chain Randomness
- When people get started they use randomness by using the block number or the block timestamp
- But everything in the blockchain is deterministic
- This leads to big security concerns where a party can gain an unfair advantage
- The only bypass to this situation is to generate a number through a trusted source that is outside of the blockchain
- Enter Oracles!!
## Oracles and Random Number generation
- Oracles act as a bridge between smart contracts and the outer world
- Oracles are a reliable source of information
- They allow the blockchain to interact with external data
- Some of the data provided by oracles :
	- prices of commodities(for prediction markets)
	- weather conditions(for insurance contracts)
- One of the services that oracles provide is randomness generation
- Through oracles, smart contracts can obtain tamper-proof random numbers
- Every oracle has a different way of generating the randomness
- We are going to learn how to generate a random number using Witnet
---
## Witnet Oracle
- Witnet is a multichain oracle that gives smart contract access to real-world information
- It is one of the oracles that are available in the cell network
- Witnet provides us with a contract using which we can call and obtain randomness
- How this work is, nodes from the witnet are randomly selected to generate a random byte that is cryptographically committed
- It is called crowd-witnessing

## Using Randomness from witnet
- Before starting to code our lottery contract, let's understand the randomness functions provided by Witnet
- You can find the code and their explanation here - https://docs.witnet.io/smart-contracts/witnet-randomness-oracle/code-examples
- Firstly we import the interface of the witnessRandomness contract
- The functionality is divided into two steps to be secure
- There is a request function and a fetch function
- First, we request a random number by paying a small fee
- it takes in the current block number and begins the process to generate a random number
- It takes around 5 to 10 minutes to generate the random number
- After 5 - 10 minutes, we can call the fetch function to obtain the random number
- This number is generated earlier and it is fetched into the contract whenever you call the fetch function
## Setup
- Create a new directory in your favorite code editor, name it Lottery
- Firstly we need to download the npm package of witnet to access the interface of the randomness contract
- Download it through this command
	- `npm I witnet-solidity-bridge`
- Now create a new solidity file called Lottery.sol
## Building the contract
- If you're curious, the entire code for the contract can be viewed in - 
- Before starting to code a project, we must have an outline of all the functionality that will be in the contract
- This contract will behave like a traditional lottery where there is an owner who will start and end the lottery
- There will be people who will join the lottery by paying the lottery amount
- So the major functionality would be
	- Start lottery -> Only Owner
	- Join the lottery
	- End lottery(picking and awarding the winner) -> Only Owner
- In our case, we are going to incorporate the two-step random number generation from Witnet
	- Generate a Random number
	- Fetch Random Number
---
- Now as we have a rough idea about the functions, let's start the coding process
- As usual, we write the license and the pragma solidity version
- We import the interface for the randomness contract
- We set the address of the randomness contract in Celo alfajores and create the instance of the interface.
---
- Let's look at all the variables we will be going through
- Firstly we have the random number itself, it is in uint32 because the randomness contract returns us a uint32
- Then we have the `entryAmount` so that the players can know the amount
- To give more information we have the last winner amount and the lottery Id
- We have the `latestRandomizingBlock` which is the block where we called the randomness function
- Coming to the address, we have:
	- Address of the owner of the contract
	- Address of the last winner(for information)
	- And finally an array of to track all the participants of the lottery
- Finally, we have a bool which shows if there is a current active lottery
---
- We have a simple constructor where we set the creator of the contract as the owner
- We have specified two modifiers to control access
	- Firstly we have the `onlyOwner` modifier which allows only the owner to perform certain functionality
	- Then we have the `onlyIfOpen` modifier which allows access to certain functions only if there is a current active lottery
- Then we have two events to log the information about the lottery
	- `Started` event logs the ID of the event and the amount
	- `Ended` event logs the ID, the address of the winner, and the winner's amount
- We have also defined the custom error `reEntry` for users who try to enter the lottery more than one time
---
- First, we have the start function which can be called by the owner
- We have a require statement to prevent starting a new lottery when there is one currently active
- The function takes the entry amount and multiplies it to 1 ether unit to convert it to 1 celo
- For example: if the input is 10, then the fee would be 10 celo
- Then we update the state variables
	- First, we set open to be true as a new lottery is started
	- Then we clear the array of players that is left from the previous round
	- Then we update the `lotteryId`
- We also emit the `Started` event with the Id and the amount
---
- Then we have the join function which is payable and can only be accessed if there is an active lottery(`onlyIfOpen`)
- First, we have a require statement to check if the user has sent the right amount
- Then we perform a check to see if the user is already entered in the lottery
- We have employed a simple for loop which iterated over the `players` array and checks if the caller is already a part of it
- If the caller is already in the array, then the function call is reverted by the custom error
- If not, the player is added to the array
---
- Next is the `requestRandomess` function which is a slightly modified version of the one from Witnet
- Instead of sending the funds from the caller,  we are going to use the funds already present in the contract to call the randomize function
- First, we set the block number
- Then we have a fee value which is set to 1 Celo as the fee is less than 1 Celo and we receive back the amount which was not utilized
- Then we call the randomize function and finally receive back the unused fee amount
---
- Finally, we have the `pickWinner` function which is going to end the lottery
- This function includes the fetching of the random number that has been generated
- This function must be called only after 5 - 10 minutes after the `requestRandomness` function to allow it to generate the random number
- Calling this function before that will result in reversion
- First, our function checks if the `requestRandomness` function has been called by checking the `latestRandomizingBlock` variable
- Then we close the lottery by setting `open` to false
- We also set the `latestRandomizingBlock` to 0 to prevent calling this function again
- Before fetching the random number, we are going to specify the range of the random number
- For our purpose, we have an array of addresses, and we need to select one person from that array
- So we specify the range to the length of the array
- Then we call the random function as per the syntax provided by Witnet
- This will return us the random number which will be the index of the winner
- As the contract holds all the entry Amounts collected in the lottery, we are going to send the entire balance of the contract to the winner
- We update the global variables of the last winner's address and the winner's amount
- We use `call` to transfer the fund
- Finally, we emit the `Ended` event to log the information of the lottery Id, winner amount, and the winner's address
---
## Testing the contract
- Finally we are done coding the contract
- You can find the entire code of the contract here - 
- Now we are going to use remix IDE and metamask to deploy the contract to the Celo alfajores network
- I have made a simple video to show you guys the functionality
- Maybe this could be optional
